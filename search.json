Henry had a far better offensive line when he was with the Titans than the Steelers with Najee Harris. You can also point out that the Steelers run two running backs, so does that take away from Najee getting carries and more yards?\nJaylen Warren, the Steelers backup running back to Harris, had 149 carries for 784 yards and averaged 5.3 yards per carry last season. Tyjae Spears, the Titans backup, had 100 carries for 453 yards and averaged 4.5 yards per carry in 2023.\nSo, if Najee Harris was used just as much as Derrick Henry, would he be in the same conversations as one of the best running backs in the league?\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\nrunback23 &lt;- read_csv(\"runback23.csv\") \n\nRows: 222 Columns: 18\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (1): player\ndbl (17): rank, att, yds, y_a, lg, x20, td, rec, tgt, rec_yds, y_r, rec_tds,...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\n\nglimpse(runback23)\n\nRows: 222\nColumns: 18\n$ rank    &lt;dbl&gt;
