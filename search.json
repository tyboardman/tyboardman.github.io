    "text": "Patrick Mahomes vs Lamar Jackson in the 2023 season.\nPatrick Mahomes and Lamar Jackson are some of the best quarterbacks in the NFL right now, but they have very different playing styles. Mahomes is a pocket passer with little speed when he wants to run and a massive arm to throw the deep ball. On the other hand, Jackson can scramble and run but doesn’t have the huge, magnificent arm that Mahomes might have.\nI wanted to compare the two quarterbacks to see how similar they may be. Lamar Jackson and Patrick Mahomes have had two MVPs throughout their careers, the most recent being the 2023 MVP Lamar Jackson. Both respected quarterbacks are top favorites yearly and will be in the league yearly.\nLamar Jackson had a phenomenal season with 67.2% of his passes completed for 3,678 yards, 24 touchdowns, and just seven interceptions; Jackson has one of his best seasons passing in 2023. His ability to push the ball downfield was demonstrated by his 8.0 yards per attempt. This 13-4 record for the Ravens is complemented by Jackson’s passer rating of 102.7. Lamar is often considered a runner, but he demonstrated last season that he could pass the ball and run to be a successful NFL quarterback.\nOn the other hand, Patrick Mahomes had 4,183 passing yards, 27 touchdowns, and a career-high 14 interceptions. However, his season was marginally less effective than his high expectations. He also had a 67.2% completion rate, although his 92.6 quarterback rating and 7.0 yards per attempt showed irregularities, in part because of his receiving corps’ dropped passes.\nLet’s compare their passing stats in 2023. For the fun of it, we will include Dak Prescott as well.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(waffle)\n\nQB_season &lt;- read_csv(\"QB_season.csv\") \n\nPatrick &lt;- QB_season |&gt; filter(PlayerName == \"Patrick Mahomes\")\n\nLamar &lt;- QB_season |&gt; filter(PlayerName == \"Lamar Jackson\")\nPrescott &lt;- QB_season |&gt; filter(PlayerName == \"Dak Prescott\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=QB_season, aes(x=PassingYDS, y=Touches), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data=Patrick, aes(x=PassingYDS, y=Touches), color=\"#E31837\") +\n  geom_point(data=Lamar, aes(x=PassingYDS, y=Touches), color=\"#241773\") +\n  geom_point(data=Prescott, aes(x=PassingYDS, y=Touches), color=\"#003594\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Lamar Jackson more touches with less passing yards.\",\n    x = \"Passing Yards\",\n    y= \"Touches\", \n    caption= \"Source: espn.com | By Ty Boardman\",\n    subtitle = \"Even though &lt;span style = 'color:#241773;'&gt;Lamar Jackson (BAL)&lt;/span&gt; got more touches on the ball, &lt;span style = 'color:#E31837;'&gt;Patrick Mahomes&lt;/span&gt; still has more passing yards This could be attributed to Lamars ability to scramble out of the pocket and run.

So, that’s what I decided to look at next. A great quarterback limits turnovers, and that leads to more wins for that team.\nLamar Jackson had seven interceptions and six fumbles in 2023, for a total of only 13 turnovers in all of his games played in 2023.\nPatrick Mahomes had a career-high 14 interceptions along with only two fumbles, making 16 turnovers in 2023, only three more than Jackson’s total turnovers.\nThe graph below shows some of the top quarterbacks in the NFL, comparing Patrick Mahomes and Lamar Jackson to the others.\n\n\nCode\nQB_season &lt;- read_csv(\"QB_season.csv\")\n\n\n\nPatrick &lt;- QB_season |&gt; filter(PlayerName == \"Patrick Mahomes\")\nLamar &lt;- QB_season |&gt; filter(PlayerName == \"Lamar Jackson\")\nPrescott &lt;- QB_season |&gt; filter(PlayerName == \"Dak Prescott\")\n\nregionalnu &lt;- QB_season |&gt; filter(Rank &lt;= 10)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=regionalnu, aes(x=reorder(PlayerName, Rank), weight=PassingInt), fill=\"lightgrey\") + \n  geom_bar(data=Patrick, aes(x=reorder(PlayerName, Rank), weight=PassingInt), fill=\"#E41C38\") +  \n  geom_bar(data=Lamar, aes(x=reorder(PlayerName, Rank), weight=PassingInt), fill=\"#241773\") + \n  geom_bar(data=Prescott, aes(x=reorder(PlayerName, Rank), weight=PassingInt), fill=\"#003594\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title=\"Patrick Mahomes with the most interceptions.\", \n    subtitle = \"&lt;span style='color:#241773;'&gt;Lamar Jackson&lt;/span&gt; has thrown the least amount of interceptions compared to the other two quarterbacks.\",\n    x= \"\",\n    y= \"Interceptions Thrown\",\n    caption = \"Source: espn.com | By Ty Boardman\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size = 10),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face =\"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 5)\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are a regular football fan, you would know Lamar Jackson should blow away close to everyone in the rushing category compared to other quarterbacks in the league.\nYes, Lamar does run more than all of his opponents in the league, but this also can create more turnovers, leading to game-changing plays in crucial moments.\nThe graph below shows just how dominant he actually is in running the football all season long compared to all the other NFL starting quarterbacks.\n\n\nCode\nQB_season &lt;- read_csv(\"QB_season.csv\") \n\nPatrick &lt;- QB_season |&gt; filter(PlayerName == \"Patrick Mahomes\")\n\nLamar &lt;- QB_season |&gt; filter(PlayerName == \"Lamar Jackson\")\nPrescott &lt;- QB_season |&gt; filter(PlayerName == \"Dak Prescott\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=QB_season, aes(x=RushingYDS, y=Fum), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data=Patrick, aes(x=RushingYDS, y=Fum), color=\"#E31837\") +\n  geom_point(data=Lamar, aes(x=RushingYDS, y=Fum), color=\"#241773\") +\n  geom_point(data=Prescott, aes(x=RushingYDS, y=Fum), color=\"#003594\") +\n  \n  scale_x_reverse() +\n  scale_y_reverse() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Lamar Jackson with the most fumbles and rushing yards\",\n    x = \"Rushing Yards\",\n    y= \"Fumbles\", \n    caption= \"Source: espn.com | By Ty Boardman\",\n    subtitle = \"&lt;span style = 'color:#241773;'&gt;Lamar Jackson (BAL)&lt;/span&gt; has the most rushing yards out of the three quarterbacks,but that comes with a price. He has 11 fumbles opposed to &lt;span style = 'color:#E31837;'&gt;Patrick Mahomes&lt;/span&gt; 5.\"\n  ) +\n   theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size = 10),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face =\"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth quarterbacks can run and pass when they please, but Lamar is doing it more regularly when running compared to Patrick Mahomes. This begs the question: How much do rushing stats and rushing touchdowns matter, or is it all in the passing stats? If Patrick Mahomes doesn’t pass for 5,000 yards and 40 touchdowns a year, does this mean Jackson should win it every year since he rushes more than Mahomes?\nYes, having an elite quarterback like Mahomes or Jackson can surely help, but you also need the team around you to do their part. Mahomes had one of his worst statistical years in his career but still ended up winning another Super Bowl, in part because of how he played in the playoffs and the people around him playing their best football.\nLamar Jackson and Patrick Mahomes have unique and different skill sets and will always be in MVP conversations as long as they are both in the league and healthy. This is an excellent estimate to see where one another compared to the other for the season of 2023, and it will be interesting to see how they compare at the end of the 2024 season."

    "text": "Steelers Running back Najee Harris vs Ravens Running back Derrick Henry in 2023\nIf you asked anyone who was the better running back between Najee Harris and Derrick Henry, everyone would immediately say Henry, but how close behind is Najee Harris actually, or is it even close at all?\nNajee Harris, in 2023, had 255 carries for 1,035 yards and averaged 4.1 yards per carry, which went along with eight touchdowns in the season—making him go over 1,000 yards rushing for the third straight year.\nOn the other hand, Derrick Henry had 280 carries for 1,167 yards and averaged 4.2 yards per carry and 12 touchdowns.\nWhile these statistics are similar, it’s essential to consider them from both angles. Henry benefited from a significantly stronger offensive line while playing for the Titans than Najee Harris’s one with the Steelers. You could also mention that the Steelers utilize two running backs. Does that mean Najee will have fewer opportunities for carries and yards?\nJaylen Warren, the Steelers backup running back to Harris, had 149 carries for 784 yards and averaged 5.3 yards per carry last season. Tyjae Spears, the Titans backup, had 100 carries for 453 yards and averaged 4.5 yards per carry in 2023.\nSo, if Najee Harris was used just as much as Derrick Henry, would he be in the same conversations as one of the best running backs in the league?\nWhen comparing running backs, you might ask yourself why I did fantasy points instead of rushing or receiving yards. Fantasy points are among the best things to compare each running back by. It combines all the rushing, receiving, and touchdowns into one.\nBelow, you can see Derrick Henry in purple and Najee in the yellow. From a fantasy perspective, they are somewhat near each other, with Henry getting around five more points per game than Najee.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(waffle)\n\nrunback23 &lt;- read_csv(\"runback23.csv\") \n\nnh &lt;- runback23 |&gt; filter(player == \"Najee Harris (PIT)\")\n\ndh &lt;- runback23 |&gt; filter(player == \"Derrick Henry (BAL)\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=runback23, aes(x=fpts_g, y=rost), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data=nh, aes(x=fpts_g, y=rost), color=\"#FFB612\") +\n  geom_point(data=dh, aes(x=fpts_g, y=rost), color=\"#241773\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 5.938298, color=\"lightblue\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Derrick Henry Is The Better Fantasy Player\",\n    x = \"Fantasy Points Per Game\",\n    y= \"Percent of Roster Player Was On\", \n    caption= \"Source: fantasypros.com | By Ty Boardman\",\n    subtitle = \"In 2023 &lt;span style = 'color:#241773;'&gt;Derrick Henry (BAL)&lt;/span&gt; performed better on a per game basis than &lt;span style = 'color:#FFB612;'&gt;Najee Harris (PIT)&lt;/span&gt; while also being a perfered fantasy running back.\"\n  ) +\n   theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size = 10),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face =\"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDerrick Henry had a ton of more production than Najee harris hents why he is farther along in the categorys.\n\n\nCode\nrunback23 |&gt; filter(g &gt; 10) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    averageyds = mean(yds),\n    averagerecyds = mean(rec_yds),\n    averagefantasy = mean(fpts_g)\n  )\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  averageyds averagerecyds averagefantasy\n       &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1       473.          176.           5.94\n\n\nCode\nnh &lt;- runback23 |&gt; filter(player == \"Najee Harris (PIT)\")\n\ndh &lt;- runback23 |&gt; filter(player == \"Derrick Henry (BAL)\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=runback23, aes(x=yds, y=rec_yds, size=g), alpha=.3, color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=nh, aes(x=yds, y=rec_yds, size=td), color=\"#FFB612\") +\n  geom_point(data=dh, aes(x=yds, y=rec_yds, size=td), color=\"#4F2683\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=nh, aes(x=yds, y=rec_yds, label=player)) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=dh, aes(x=yds, y=rec_yds, label=player)) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 472.5319, color=\"lightblue\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 175.8511, color=\"lightblue\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Derrick Henry Performs Better\",\n    x = \"Rushing Yds\",\n    y= \"Recieving Yds\", \n    caption= \"Source: fantasypros.com | By Ty Boardman\",\n    subtitle = '&lt;span style=\"color:#4F2683\"&gt;Derrick Henry&lt;/span&gt; vs. &lt;span style=\"color:#FFB612\"&gt;Najee Harris&lt;/span&gt;: Power vs. Versatility in the NFL Backfield'\n  ) +\n   theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size = 10),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face =\"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  ) +\n  scale_size(name = \"Touchdowns\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLets take a look at just how much more Henry is utilized over Harris in every category.\n\n\nCode\nrunback23 &lt;- read_csv(\"runback23.csv\")\n\nplayer1 &lt;- runback23 |&gt; filter(player == \"Najee Harris (PIT)\")\n\nplayer2 &lt;- runback23 |&gt; filter(player == \"Derrick Henry (BAL)\")\n\nnjuse &lt;- c(\"Rush Attempts\"=player1[[\"att\"]], \"Targets\"=player1[[\"att\"]])\ndjuse &lt;- c(\"Rush Attempts\"=player2[[\"att\"]], \"Targets\"=player2[[\"att\"]])\n\niron(\nwaffle(\n  njuse,\n  rows=10,\n  xlab=\"Najee Harris Utilization\",\n  title=\"Utilization largely the same between both star running backs\",\n  colors = c(\"#FFB612\", \"black\")\n),\nwaffle(\n  djuse,\n  rows=16,\n  xlab=\"Derrick Henry Utilization\",\n  colors = c(\"purple\", \"black\")\n))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDerrick Henry is easily one of the best running backs in all of the National Football League. But when you break down the numbers, he is getting an enormous amount of utilization year in and year out compared to teams that run two-back systems or teams who might not have a top running back in the league.\nBut you also have to consider it from a different perspective: Would you want to pay Henry over 10 million a year or Najee Harris 4 million a year? If you are a high-spending team, you could splurge and sign Henry, but if you are a team that doesn’t have the spending or money to do so, you might want to look at Harris, who could give you production, just not the explosiveness Henry brings to the table.\nDerrick Henry will always be one of the best in the NFL, but is Najee Harris an underrated back in the NFL that doesn’t get talked about enough?"
