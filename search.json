    "text": "Steelers Running back Najee Harris vs Ravens Running back Derrick Henry in 2023\nIf you asked anyone who was the better running back between Najee Harris and Derrick Henry, everyone would immediately say Henry, but how close behind is Najee Harris actually, or is it even close at all?\nNajee Harris, in 2023, had 255 carries for 1,035 yards and averaged 4.1 yards per carry, which went along with eight touchdowns in the season—making him go over 1,000 yards rushing for the third straight year.\nOn the other hand, Derrick Henry had 280 carries for 1,167 yards and averaged 4.2 yards per carry and 12 touchdowns.\nWhile these statistics are similar, it’s essential to consider them from both angles. Henry benefited from a significantly stronger offensive line while playing for the Titans than Najee Harris’s one with the Steelers. You could also mention that the Steelers utilize two running backs. Does that mean Najee will have fewer opportunities for carries and yards?\nJaylen Warren, the Steelers backup running back to Harris, had 149 carries for 784 yards and averaged 5.3 yards per carry last season. Tyjae Spears, the Titans backup, had 100 carries for 453 yards and averaged 4.5 yards per carry in 2023.\nSo, if Najee Harris was used just as much as Derrick Henry, would he be in the same conversations as one of the best running backs in the league?\nWhen comparing running backs, you might ask yourself why I did fantasy points instead of rushing or receiving yards. Fantasy points are among the best things to compare each running back by. It combines all the rushing, receiving, and touchdowns into one.\nBelow, you can see Derrick Henry in purple and Najee in the yellow. From a fantasy perspective, they are somewhat near each other, with Henry getting around five more points per game than Najee.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(waffle)\n\nrunback23 &lt;- read_csv(\"runback23.csv\") \n\nnh &lt;- runback23 |&gt; filter(player == \"Najee Harris (PIT)\")\n\ndh &lt;- runback23 |&gt; filter(player == \"Derrick Henry (BAL)\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=runback23, aes(x=fpts_g, y=rost), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data=nh, aes(x=fpts_g, y=rost), color=\"#FFB612\") +\n  geom_point(data=dh, aes(x=fpts_g, y=rost), color=\"#241773\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 5.938298, color=\"lightblue\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Derrick Henry Is The Better Fantasy Player\",\n    x = \"Fantasy Points Per Game\",\n    y= \"Percent of Roster Player Was On\", \n    caption= \"Source: fantasypros.com | By Ty Boardman\",\n    subtitle = \"In 2023 &lt;span style = 'color:#241773;'&gt;Derrick Henry (BAL)&lt;/span&gt; performed better on a per game basis than &lt;span style = 'color:#FFB612;'&gt;Najee Harris (PIT)&lt;/span&gt; while also being a perfered fantasy running back.\"\n  ) +\n   theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size = 10),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face =\"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDerrick Henry had a ton of more production than Najee harris hents why he is farther along in the categorys.\n\n\nCode\nrunback23 |&gt; filter(g &gt; 10) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    averageyds = mean(yds),\n    averagerecyds = mean(rec_yds),\n    averagefantasy = mean(fpts_g)\n  )\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  averageyds averagerecyds averagefantasy\n       &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1       473.          176.           5.94\n\n\nCode\nnh &lt;- runback23 |&gt; filter(player == \"Najee Harris (PIT)\")\n\ndh &lt;- runback23 |&gt; filter(player == \"Derrick Henry (BAL)\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=runback23, aes(x=yds, y=rec_yds, size=g), alpha=.3, color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=nh, aes(x=yds, y=rec_yds, size=td), color=\"#FFB612\") +\n  geom_point(data=dh, aes(x=yds, y=rec_yds, size=td), color=\"#4F2683\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=nh, aes(x=yds, y=rec_yds, label=player)) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=dh, aes(x=yds, y=rec_yds, label=player)) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 472.5319, color=\"lightblue\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 175.8511, color=\"lightblue\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Derrick Henry Performs Better\",\n    x = \"Rushing Yds\",\n    y= \"Recieving Yds\", \n    caption= \"Source: fantasypros.com | By Ty Boardman\",\n    subtitle = '&lt;span style=\"color:#4F2683\"&gt;Derrick Henry&lt;/span&gt; vs. &lt;span style=\"color:#FFB612\"&gt;Najee Harris&lt;/span&gt;: Power vs. Versatility in the NFL Backfield'\n  ) +\n   theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size = 10),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face =\"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  ) +\n  scale_size(name = \"Touchdowns\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLets take a look at just how much more Henry is utilized over Harris in every category.\n\n\nCode\nrunback23 &lt;- read_csv(\"runback23.csv\")\n\nplayer1 &lt;- runback23 |&gt; filter(player == \"Najee Harris (PIT)\")\n\nplayer2 &lt;- runback23 |&gt; filter(player == \"Derrick Henry (BAL)\")\n\nnjuse &lt;- c(\"Rush Attempts\"=player1[[\"att\"]], \"Targets\"=player1[[\"att\"]])\ndjuse &lt;- c(\"Rush Attempts\"=player2[[\"att\"]], \"Targets\"=player2[[\"att\"]])\n\niron(\nwaffle(\n  njuse,\n  rows=10,\n  xlab=\"Najee Harris Utilization\",\n  title=\"Utilization largely the same between both star running backs\",\n  colors = c(\"#FFB612\", \"black\")\n),\nwaffle(\n  djuse,\n  rows=16,\n  xlab=\"Derrick Henry Utilization\",\n  colors = c(\"purple\", \"black\")\n))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDerrick Henry is easily one of the best running backs in all of the National Football League. But when you break down the numbers, he is getting an enormous amount of utilization year in and year out compared to teams that run two-back systems or teams who might not have a top running back in the league.\nBut you also have to consider it from a different perspective: Would you want to pay Henry over 10 million a year or Najee Harris 4 million a year? If you are a high-spending team, you could splurge and sign Henry, but if you are a team that doesn’t have the spending or money to do so, you might want to look at Harris, who could give you production, just not the explosiveness Henry brings to the table.\nDerrick Henry will always be one of the best in the NFL, but is Najee Harris an underrated back in the NFL that doesn’t get talked about enough?"
